todolist app will dispaly the the to do list of the user 
item =["buy mangoes", "do work"]

Todolist will get the string input ftom the user.


TodolistComponent will show that array item as list.
 
for that we will need unordered list, 
<ul>
    <li></li>
<\ul>

For this we will use map feature.

Map simply traverses the array, and stores the  item of the array in the iterator by one by one. 

item.map(itr=>{
<li>{itr}</li>})

Map doesnt traverse in some proper order.
for that we will improve the array.
item array will have objects.

item=[{text:"do work" id=(time at which the entry havebeen made.)};]
<li key={this.id}> {itr.text} </li>
